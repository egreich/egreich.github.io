<p> <br><br> All science is based in wonder. In fact, it was a yearning for adventure that led me to pursue ecology in the first place. Whether measuring water potentials of oaks in northern California, collecting algae in French Polynesia, identifying plants in the arctic, or censusing fossils in New Mexico, I have found the act of discovery that comes with research inexplicably exciting.</p>
