### RESEARCH
	
**Graduate Research Assistant**, Northern Arizona University (2020)
- Project— Ecohydrological controls on evapotranspiration across a semiarid elevation gradient, PI: Kimberly Samuels-Crow

**Research Assistant**, UC Berkeley, Ackerly Lab (2017-19)
- Collaborated on project on vulnerability to embolism in California oaks led by Dr. Robert Skelton and Dr. Leander Anderegg.
- Independent research on flower phenology and pollinator resources across a heterogeneous grassland landscape after fire disturbance.
- Assisted with project on phenology dynamics in California grassland communities as part of doctoral candidate Rachael Olliff Yang’s dissertation.
- Assisted with project on genetic diversity in red oaks. 

**Field Biologist/Student Researcher**, Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, Mo’orea, French Polynesia (2018)
- Studied the effects of temperature on decalcification in crustose coralline algae and the susceptibility to grazing of crustose coralline algae from different thermal environments.

**Research Assistant, UC Berkeley**, Sousa Lab (2017)  
- Prepared leaves for stable isotope analysis and determined soil chemical composition as a part of doctoral candidate Audrey Hayne’s dissertation.
