### RESEARCH
	
**Graduate Research Assistant**, Northern Arizona University (2020)
- Contributed to project on *Ecohydrological controls on evapotranspiration across a semiarid elevation gradient*, under the mentorship of Dr. Kiona Ogle and Dr. Kimberly Samuels-Crow.

**Research Assistant**, UC Berkeley, Ackerly Lab (2017-19)
- Collaborated on project on vulnerability to embolism in California oaks led by Dr. Robert Skelton and Dr. Leander Anderegg.
- Independent research on flower phenology and pollinator resources across a heterogeneous grassland landscape after fire disturbance.
- Assisted with project on phenology dynamics in California grassland communities as part of doctoral candidate Rachael Olliff Yang’s dissertation.
- Assisted with project on genetic diversity in red oaks. 

**Field Biologist/Student Researcher**, Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, Mo’orea, French Polynesia (2018)
- Studied the effects of temperature on decalcification in crustose coralline algae and the susceptibility to grazing of crustose coralline algae from different thermal environments.

**Research Assistant**, UC Berkeley, Sousa Lab (2017)  
- Prepared leaves for stable isotope analysis and determined soil chemical composition as a part of doctoral candidate Audrey Hayne’s dissertation.

**Research Assistant**, UC Berkeley, Koehl Lab (2016)
- Recorded movement patterns of marine larvae in response to acceleration from videos on Image J and recorded data in Excel. Observed biomechanical response and larval  settlement of organisms swimming in turbulent flow.

**Research Assistant**, UC Berkeley, Looy Lab (2016)
- Assisted with project on the diversity of tropical plant fossils from the Cretaceous period as part of Dr. Dori Contreras’ dissertation.


### TECHNICIAN POSITIONS

**Field Technician**, National Ecological Observatory Network, Alaska (2019)
- Collected vegetation diversity data in northern Alaska taiga and tundra ecosystems.

**Prep Room Assistant**, UC Berkeley, Museum of Paleontology (2018-19)
- Prepared marine vertebrate and invertebrate fossils from the Miocene as a part of the Calaveras Dam project.
