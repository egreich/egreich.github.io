<p>I am a PhD candidate in Dr. Kiona Ogle's <a href="https://ogle-lab.nau.edu/">Ecological Synthesis Lab</a> at Northern Arizona University, studying plant ecophysiology and ecosystem water fluxes
      in semi-arid ecosystems. My research interests include evapotranspiration partitioning, eddy covariance flux tower measurements, and Bayesian modeling.
      I'm currently working on modeling transpiration, evaporation, and water-use efficiency for ecosystems in New Mexico to better understand the biotic and abiotic drivers of dryland water fluxes and plant-water interactions throughout the year.</p>
<p> In May 2019, I graduated from the University of California Berkeley with a BS in Molecular Environmental Biology and a concentration in Ecology.
      At Berkeley, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the Ackerly Lab, where I studied blue oak physiology and northern California grassland ecology. I also
      cleaned and repaired <a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/calaveras-project/">whale skulls</a> and other fun things for the <a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/">UC Museum of Paleontology</a>.
      In the fall of 2018, I studied <a href="http://www.moorea-ucb.org/uploads/1/1/8/3/118334900/reich_final.pdf">crustose coralline algae</a> at the <a href="https://www.moorea.berkeley.edu/">Gump Station</a> in Moorea, French Polynesia.</p>
<p>In 2020 and 2021, other Informatics graduate students and I worked to create the Informatics Graduate Student Association and the Broadening Participation Committee at NAU. For more information about the Informatics Graduate Student Association, please look <a href="https://igsa-siccs.github.io/">here</a>. </p>
