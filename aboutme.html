<p> <br><br> I'm a PhD student in Kiona Ogle's <a href="https://ogle-lab.nau.edu/">Ecological Synthesis Lab</a> at Northern Arizona University and I study plant ecophysiology
      in semiarid ecosystems. My research interests include stable isotope analysis, evapotranspiration partitioning, and flux tower measurements. </p>
<p> <br> In May 2019, I graduated from the University of California Berkeley with a BS in Molecular Environmental Biology and a concentration in Ecology. 
      At Berkeley, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the Ackerly Lab, where I studied blue oak physiology and northern California grassland ecology. I also
      cleaned and repaired <a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/calaveras-project/">whale skulls</a> and other fun things for the <a href="https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/">UC Museum of Paleontology</a>. 
      In the fall of 2018, I studied <a href="http://www.moorea-ucb.org/uploads/1/1/8/3/118334900/reich_final.pdf">crustose coralline algae</a> at the <a href="https://www.moorea.berkeley.edu/">Gump Station</a> in Moorea, French Polynesia. <br><br></p>
